# Koha_basics

These are some scripts that I believe could :hocho: shorten :hocho:, the time taken setting up and running koha on a new linux system.

> Check this out. Looks important

## Disclaimer :ghost:

It is possible to run into some bugs with this set of tools. This is mostly because,  :electric_plug: :coffee: :eyes: _I run out of coffee_ . :persevere::persevere: 
On a serious note : 

- yes bugs are there and its probably a fault in the code.
- Yes, you are more than welcome to tweak it and fix.
- **Have fun using and fixing it.**

### Note 
Most of these are simply the instructions listed in the [Official koha documentation](https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Category:Documentation)
and some tips are from  [koha geek](http://kohageek.blogspot.com/) among other sources. Feel free to counter check anything that doesn't work as it 
should or seems :fish: :dolphin: fishy. :whale::fish:
